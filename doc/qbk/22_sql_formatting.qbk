[section:sql_formatting (Experimental) Client-side SQL query formatting]
[nochunk]

When issuing queries that contain untrusted input, prepared statement are usually
the way to go. However, some use cases like dynamic filters or batch inserts
are not attainable using them.

The functions described in this section can be used to compose SQL query
strings dynamically client-side while keeping your application secure.

[note
    This feature is experimental. Its API may change in subsequent releases.
]

[heading Common use cases]

* Queries involving many filters that can be enabled dynamically.
  See [link mysql.examples.dynamic_filters this example].
* Batch inserts. Inserting rows one by one can lead to poor efficiency.
  You can use client-side query formatting to compose a single `INSERT` that
  performs several insertions at once. See [link mysql.examples.batch_inserts this example]
  for simple batch inserts and [link mysql.examples.batch_inserts_generic this other] for
  a generic utility to implement this case.
* PATCH-like updates. If your query must update fields dynamically, based on some input,
  prepared statements may not be suitable. See [link mysql.examples.patch_updates this example].
* Queries involving dynamic identifiers, like table and field names.
* Performing sorting conditionally.
* Any other use case that involves SQL that can change dynamically.

This feature can also be used to improve efficiency, as text queries perform less
round-trips to the server. See [link mysql.sql_formatting.efficiency this section]
for more info.

[warning
    [*Security considerations]: misusing the tools described in this section
    can lead to [*SQL injection vulnerabilities]. Please read the documentation
    carefully and thoroughly test your code when using this feature.

[heading Formatting simple queries]

You can use [reflink format_sql] to generate a string query from a format string
and a set of parameters, using a notation similar to `std::format`:

```
std::string employee_name = get_name(); // employee_name is an untrusted string

// Compose the SQL query in the client
std::string query = boost::mysql::format_sql("SELECT id, salary FROM employee WHERE last_name = {}",
  conn.format_opts().value(), employee_name);

// If employee_name is "John", query now contains:
// SELECT id, salary FROM employee WHERE last_name = 'John'
// If employee_name contains quotes, they will be escaped as required

// Execute the generated query as a normal query
results result;
conn.execute(query, result);
```

[reflink format_sql] doesn't involve communication with the server.
In order to work, it requires a [reflink format_options] instance describing
connection configuration, like the character set currently in use.
[refmem any_connection format_opts] provides an easy way to retrieve these.

[note
  Getting an `unknown_character_set` error? Have a look at [link mysql.format_sql.unknown_character_set this section].
]

[note
  `format_opts` is only available for [reflink any_connection].
]

All fundamental types can be used with query formatting. This includes integers, floating point types,
strings, blobs, dates and times:

```
std::string query = boost::mysql::format_sql(
  "SELECT id, first_name, last_name FROM employee WHERE salary > {}",
  conn.format_opts().value(), 42000);
// SELECT id, first_name, last_name FROM employee WHERE salary > 42000
```

`std::optional<T>` and `boost::optional<T>` can also be used:

```
std::optional<std::string> last_name; // get last_name from the user

std::string query = boost::mysql::format_sql(
  "INSERT INTO employee (salary, last_name) VALUES ({}, {})",
  conn.format_opts().value(), 42000, last_name);

// Depending on whether last_name has a value or not, generates:
// INSERT INTO employee (salary, last_name) VALUES (42000, 'John')
// INSERT INTO employee (salary, last_name) VALUES (42000, NULL)
```

See [link mysql.sql_formatting.reference this table] for a reference of types
that have built-in support for SQL formatting.

[note
  Like with `std::format`, the string passed to `format_sql` must be known at
  compile-time. You can skip this check using the [reflink runtime] function.
]

[heading Formatting identifiers]

By default, strings are formatted as values. If you need to generate a dynamic
SQL identifier (like a field or table name), you need to use the [reflink identifier] class:

```
std::string query = boost::mysql::format_sql(
  "SELECT id, last_name FROM employee ORDER BY {} DESC",
  conn.format_opts().value(), identifier("company_id"));
// SELECT id, last_name FROM employee ORDER BY `company_id` DESC
```

[reflink identifier] can also generate qualified identifiers:

```
std::string query = boost::mysql::format_sql(
  R"%SQL(
    SELECT salary, tax_id FROM employee
    INNER JOIN company ON employee.company_id = company.id
    ORDER BY {} DESC
  )SQL",
  conn.format_opts().value(), identifier("company", "id));
// SELECT ... ORDER BY `company`.`id` DESC
```

[heading Stream SQL formatting with format_context]

Advanced use cases, like batch inserts or dynamic filters, may not be
expressible in terms of format strings. [reflink format_context]
provides a way to incrementally build query strings:

```
// Compose an update query that sets first_name, last_name, or both
std::string compose_update_query(
    format_options opts,
    std::int64_t employee_id,
    std::optional<std::string> new_first_name,
    std::optional<std::string> new_last_name
)
{
    // There should be at least one update
    assert(new_first_name || new_last_name);

    // format_context will accumulate the query as we compose it
    format_context ctx (opts);

    // append_raw will add raw SQL, without quoting or escaping
    ctx.append_raw("UPDATE employee SET ");
    
    if (new_first_name)
    {
        // append_value will behave like a {} expansion field.
        // It will add the given string as a value, performing quoting and escaping
        ctx.append_raw("first_name = ");
        ctx.append_value(*new_first_name);
    }
    if (new_last_name)
    {
        if (new_first_name)
            ctx.append_raw(", ");
        ctx.append_raw("last_name = ");
        ctx.append_value(*new_last_name);
    }

    ctx.append_raw(") WHERE ID = ");

    // append_value can be passed any type that can be used with format_sql
    ctx.append_value(employee_id);

    // Retrieve the generated query string
    return ctx.get().value();
}

std::string query = compose_update_query(conn.format_opts().value(), 42, "John", {});
// UPDATE employee SET first_name = 'John' WHERE id = 42
```

[note
    Strings passed to [refmem format_context append_raw] must be known at compile-time.
    You can bypass this check using the [reflink runtime] function.
]

[warning
    [*SQL injection warning]: misusing `format_context` may lead to vulnerabilities.
    If you are composing complex queries, be sure to [link mysql.sql_formatting.unit_test unit test]
    your code thoroughly.
]

[heading Extending format_sql and format_context]

You can specialize [reflink formatter] to add formatting support for custom types.
The notation resembles `std::format` but is much simpler, since format specs are not supported.

```

struct employee {
    std::string first_name;
    std::string last_name;
    double salary;
};

namespace boost {
namespace mysql {

struct formatter<employee>
{
    static void format(const employee& emp, format_context_base& ctx)
    {
        // We should format the employee using append_raw and append_value.
        // We will make this suitable for INSERT statements
        ctx.append_value(first_name)
            .append_raw(", ")
            .append_value(last_name)
            .append_raw(", ")
            .append_value(salary);
    }
};

}  // namespace mysql
}  // namespace boost

// We can now use employee as a built-in value
employee emp1, emp2; // these are untrusted
std::string query = boost::mysql::format_sql(
    "INSERT INTO employee (first_name, last_name, salary) VALUES ({}), ({})",
    conn.format_opts().value(),
    emp1,
    emp2
);

// You can also use format_context::append_value passing an employee
```

[heading:unit_test Unit testing]

If you are composing very complex queries, it's very advisable to unit test them.
For instance, to test the `compose_update_query` above:

```
// For reference, the function under test
std::string compose_update_query(
    format_options opts,
    std::int64_t employee_id,
    std::optional<std::string> new_first_name,
    std::optional<std::string> new_last_name
);

// Your test body.

// You can safely use these format_options for testing,
// since they are the most common ones.
format_options opts { utf8mb4_charset, true };

// Test for the different cases
ASSERT_EQ(compose_update_query(opts, 42, "Bob", {}) == "UPDATE employee SET first_name = 'Bob' WHERE id = 42");
ASSERT_EQ(compose_update_query(opts, 42, {}, "Alice") == "UPDATE employee SET last_name = 'Alice' WHERE id = 42");
ASSERT_EQ(compose_update_query(opts, 0, "Bob", "Alice") == "UPDATE employee SET first_name = 'Bob', last_name = 'Alice' WHERE id = 42");
```

In tests, it's safe to manually create a [reflink format_options] value like the one above.
But don't do it in production code!

[heading:unknown_character_set Solving the `unknown_character_set` error]

If you are getting a [refmem client_errc unknown_character_set] error, your connection
is being unable to track the current character set. Try the following:

* Make sure that you are performing connection establishment ([refmem any_connection connect] or
  [refmem any_connection async_connect]) before calling this function.
* Use [refmem any_connection set_character_set] or [refmem any_connection async_set_character_set]
  to set your connection's character set instead of using raw SQL.
* Some [refmem connect_params connection_collation] values are not supported by all servers
  and often trigger behavior. If you are using a non-UTF8 character set, prefer setting it
  explicitly using [refmem any_connection set_character_set] or [refmem any_connection async_set_character_set].
* [refmem any_connection reset_connection] and [refmem any_connection async_reset_connection] wipe
  character set information. Call [refmem any_connection set_character_set] or [refmem any_connection async_set_character_set]
  after resetting your connection.

[warning
  [*Security considerations]: don't craft [reflink format_options] values manually.
  Always use [refmem any_connection format_opts].
]

[*Background]: MySQL has many configuration options that affect its syntax. There are two options that affect how
string values are escaped and formatted:

* Whether the backslash character represents a escape sequence or not. By default they do,
  but this can be disabled dynamically by setting the
  [@https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-mode.html#sqlmode_no_backslash_escapes NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES] SQL mode.
  This is tracked by [reflink any_connection] automatically.
* The connection's [*current character set]. This is tracked by connections as far as possible, but deficiencies
  in the protocol create cases where the character set may not be known to the client. This is why
  [refmem any_connection format_opts] returns a `boost::system::result<format_options>` that will
  contain an error in case the character set is unknown.

For a reference on how character set tracking works, please read [link mysql.charsets.tracking this section].




















[heading:efficiency Efficiency considerations]

* Client-composed SQL is more flexible. Some use cases can only be achieved using client-side composed queries.
* Client-composed SQL entails less round-trips to the server than prepared statements,

so it may yield
  better efficiency in some cases. On the other hand, prepared statements use a more compact binary
  protocol, which can be faster when transferring a lot of data.
* 

                comparison with prepared statements <= when does using queries vs statements help performance-wise?
