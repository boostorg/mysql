[section:tutorial_error_handling Tutorial 7: Error handling]

The [link mysql.tutorial_connection_pool previous tutorial]
did not include any error handling. When an error is encountered
while talking to the DB or the client, an exception is thrown and
the program terminates. This is undesirable in server programs like the one we're writing.

To add error handling, we can just add try/catch blocks to prevent exception propagation.
However, many code bases discourage the use of exceptions for non-exceptional circumstances,
like I/O errors. In this tutorial, we will learn how to manage I/O errors without exceptions
by using [asioreflink as_tuple as_tuple] and error codes.


[heading Error handling strategy]

There are two kind of I/O errors that our program can encounter:

* Reading and writing to the client may fail. This can happen if
  the client program is faulty or a network error happens.
  In this case, we should log the problem and close the connection.
* Talking to the database may fail. This can happen if [refmemunq connection_pool async_get_connection]
  is cancelled because of a timeout. In this case, we will return a special string (`"ERROR"`)
  to the client, signalling that we can't fulfill the request, and log the problem.

Additionally, we will modify how we use `asio::cancel_after` to make the system more reliable.




[heading Completion tokens]

Before proceeding, we need to understand what a completion token is.
The concepts in this section are not specific to Boost.MySQL, but apply
to Asio and all Asio-compatible libraries. Since Asio docs can be terse,
we explain them here to facilitate the reader.

All asynchronous operations accept an optional parameter specifying what
to do when the operation completes. If present, this parameter is always the last one.
This last parameter is the
[@boost:/doc/html/boost_asio/reference/asynchronous_operations.html#boost_asio.reference.asynchronous_operations.completion_tokens_and_handlers completion token].

Callbacks are valid completion tokens. Taking [refmemunq connection_pool async_get_connection]
as example, the following is valid:

```
// Function to call when async_get_connection completes
auto on_available_connection = [](boost::system::error_code ec, mysql::pooled_connection conn) {
  // Do something useful with the connection 
};

// Start the operation. on_available_connection will be called when the operation
// completes. on_available_connection is the completion token.
pool.async_get_connection(on_available_connection);
```

We have already been using this when creating coroutines with `asio::co_spawn`.
This function is also an async operation, and the callback we pass as final parameter,
a completion token.

You might consider using callbacks if your compiler doesn't support coroutines,
or just by personal preference. [link mysql.examples.callbacks This example]
demonstrates how to use them.

If you don't specify a completion token, the operation's [*default completion token]
will be used. This is usually `asio::deferred` or `mysql::with_diagnostics(asio::deferred)`.
[footnote [reflink with_diagnostics] is an adapter completion token that enhances
thrown exceptions with a diagnostic string supplied by the server.
`mysql::with_diagnostics(asio::deferred)` is otherwise equivalent to `asio::deferred`.].
These tokens transform asynchronous operations into awaitables,
so we can use them in C++20 coroutines.

The default completion token for [refmemunq connection_pool async_get_connection] is
`mysql::with_diagnostics(asio::deferred)`. This means that the following two are equivalent:

```
// These two lines are equivalent.
// Both of them can be read as "I want to use C++20 coroutines as my completion style"
auto conn1 = co_await pool.async_get_connection();
auto conn2 = co_await pool.async_get_connection(mysql::with_diagnostics(asio::deferred));
```

Completion tokens are generic: once you learn how to use one, you can use it
with any Asio-compliant async operation. This includes all functions in Boost.Asio,
Boost.MySQL, Boost.Beast and Boost.Redis. We say that operations in these libraries
are compliant with Asio's universal async model. Writing these is hard, but they're easy to use!





[heading Adapter completion tokens]

Some tokens don't fully specify what to do when the operation completes,
but rather modify some aspect of how the operation executes.
They wrap (or adapt) other completion tokens. The underlying token
determines what to actually do when the operation completes.

[asioreflink cancel_after cancel_after] is an adapter token.
It modifies how an operation executes by setting a timeout,
but it doesn't specify what to do on completion.

Adapter tokens can be passed an optional completion token
as the last argument. If the token is omitted, the default
one will be used. Continuing with our example:

```
// Enable the use of the "s" suffix for std::chrono::seconds
using namespace std::chrono_literals;

// The following two lines are equivalent.
// If no token is passed to cancel_after, the default one will be used,
// which transforms the operation into an awaitable.
// asio::cancel_after(20s) is usually termed "partial completion token"
auto conn1 = co_await pool.async_get_connection(asio::cancel_after(20s));
auto conn2 = co_await pool.async_get_connection(
    asio::cancel_after(20s, mysql::with_diagnostics(asio::deferred))
);
```


[heading Handler signature and exceptions]

Each async operation has an associated handler signature.
We can find these signatures in the documentation for each operation.
The handler signature is the prototype that a callback function
passed as completion token would need to have to be compatible with the operation.

The handler signature for [refmemunq connection_pool async_get_connection]
is `void(boost::system::error_code, mysql::pooled_connection)`.

However, when we invoke `co_await` on the awaitable returned by `async_get_connection`,
we don't get any `error_code`. This is because `co_await` inspects
the handler signature at compile-time, looking for an `error_code` as first parameter.
If it finds it, `co_await` will remove it from the argument list, returning
only the `pooled_connection`. At runtime, the error code is checked.
If the code indicates a failure, an exception is thrown.

This mechanism is important to understand how `as_tuple` works.




[heading asio::as_tuple]

[asioreflink as_tuple as_tuple] is another adapter completion token
that can be used to prevent exceptions. It modifies the operation's
handler signature, packing all arguments into a `std::tuple`.
This inhibits the automatic error code checks explained in the previous section, 
thus preventing exceptions on I/O failure. Continuing with our example:

[tutorial_error_handling_get_connection_as_tuple]

In practice, it's usually better to use structured bindings:

```
// ec is an error_code, conn is the mysql::pooled_connection
auto [ec, conn] = co_await pool.async_get_connection(asio::as_tuple);
```

All the properties of adapter completion tokens apply:

```
// The following two lines are equivalent.
// Both of them produce an awaitable that returns a tuple when awaited.
auto [ec1, conn1] = co_await pool.async_get_connection(asio::as_tuple);
auto [ec2, conn2] = co_await pool.async_get_connection(
  asio::as_tuple(mysql::with_diagnostics(asio::deferred))
);
```

Adapter tokens can be combined. To apply a timeout to the operation
while avoiding exceptions, you can use:

```
// ec is an error_code, conn is the mysql::pooled_connection
// Apply a timeout and don't throw on error
auto [ec, conn] = co_await pool.async_get_connection(
  asio::cancel_after(20s, asio::as_tuple)
);
```





[heading Using asio::as_tuple for database code]

Let's apply [asioreflink as_tuple as_tuple] to our database logic.
We will remove timeouts for now - we will add them back later.

[tutorial_error_handling_db_nodiag]






[heading Diagnostics objects]

While what we wrote works, it can be improved. When a database operation fails, the server
may supply an error string with information about what went wrong. Boost.MySQL may also
generate such strings in certain cases. We get this automatically
when using exceptions. Thanks to [reflink with_diagnostics] and default completion tokens,
the library throws [reflink error_with_diagnostics] objects,
which inherit from `boost::system::system_error`
and have a [refmemunq error_with_diagnostics get_diagnostics] member.

When using error codes, we need to handle diagnostics manually.
All functions in Boost.MySQL are overloaded to accept a [reflink diagnostics]
output parameter. It will be populated with extra information in case of error.

Let's update our code to use diagnostics:

[tutorial_error_handling_db]

We also need to write the function to log errors:

[tutorial_error_handling_log_error]

[refmem diagnostics client_message] and [refmem diagnostics server_message] differ
in their origin. Client messages never contain user-supplied input, and can always
be used safely. Server messages may contain user input, and should be treated with
more caution (logging them is fine).





[heading Using asio::as_tuple with client reads and writes]

Since `asio::read` and `asio::write` are compliant async operations,
we can use [asioreflink as_tuple as_tuple] with them, too:


```
asio::awaitable<void> handle_session(mysql::connection_pool& pool, asio::ip::tcp::socket client_socket)
{
    // Read the request from the client.
    unsigned char message[8]{};
    auto [ec1, bytes_read] = co_await asio::async_read(
        client_socket,
        asio::buffer(message),
        asio::as_tuple
    );
    if (ec1)
    {
        log_error("Error reading from the socket", ec1);
        co_return;
    }

    // Process the request as before (omitted)

    // Write the response back to the client.
    auto [ec2, bytes_written] = co_await asio::async_write(
        client_socket,
        asio::buffer(response),
        asio::as_tuple
    );
    if (ec2)
    {
        log_error("Error writing to the socket", ec2);
        co_return;
    }
}
```





[heading Timeouts]

Our code has three logical steps:

* Read a request from the client.
* Access the database.
* Write the response to the client.

Each of these steps may take long to complete. We will set a separate timeout
to each one.

Client reads and writes are the easiest ones to handle -
we just need to combine `as_tuple` and `cancel_after`:

[tutorial_error_handling_read_timeout]

The database logic is more involved. Ideally, we would like
to set a timeout to the overall database access operation, rather
than to individual steps. However, a `co_await` expression
isn't an async operation, and can't be passed a completion token.
We can fix this by replacing plain `co_await` by `asio::co_spawn`,
which accepts a completion token:

[tutorial_error_handling_db_timeout]

With these modifications, the session handler becomes:

[tutorial_error_handling_session]

With these modifications, our server is ready!
