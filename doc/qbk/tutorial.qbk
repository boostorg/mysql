[section:tutorial Tutorial]

[import ../../example/tutorial.cpp]

Welcome to Boost.Mysql's tutorial. We will go through the simplest
possible piece of code using Boost.Mysql: a program that connects
to the MySQL server and issues the query `SELECT "Hello World!"`.

This tutorial assumes you have a running MySQL server listening
in localhost on port 3306 (the default one). You should have
the credentials of a valid MySQL user (username and password).
No further setup is needed.

This tutorial assumes you have a basic familiarity with __Asio__
(e.g. you know what a [asioreflink io_context io_context] is).

[heading Connection object]

The first step is to create a connection object, which 
represents a single connection over TCP to the MySQL server.
We will be using [reflink tcp_ssl_connection], which supports TLS.
If you're using the latest MySQL version with its default configuration,
you will need to use TLS to successfully establish a connection.

A [reflink tcp_ssl_connection] is an I/O object. It can be constructed from a
[asioreflink io_context/executor_type io_context::executor_type] and a
[asioreflink ssl__context ssl::context]:

[tutorial_connection]

[heading Connecting to the server]

The next step is to connect to the server. We will use the function
[reflink2 connection.connect tcp_ssl_connection::connect],
which accepts two parameters:

* Physical connection parameters. As we are using TCP, this is a
  [asioreflink ip__tcp/endpoint ip::tcp::endpoint],
  identifying the host and port to connect to.
* MySQL handshake parameters. This is an instance of
  [reflink connection_params], containing the username and password.
  You may also set other options like the database name to connect to
  or whether to use SSL or not.
  
[tutorial_connect]

[note
    Read-only strings, like the ones used in [reflink connection_params]'s
    constructor, are represented as `boost::string_view`s, which are similar
    to `std::string_view`s but do not require C++17 to work.
]

[heading Issuing the SQL query]

The next step is to issue the query to the server. We will use
[reflink2 connection.query tcp_ssl_connection::query],
which accepts a string containing a single SQL query and instructs
the server to run it. It returns a [reflink tcp_resultset] 
object, containing the query results:

[tutorial_query]

[heading Reading the results]

A [reflink resultset] is an object that represents the result of a query,
in tabular format. Resultsets are not containers, but I/O objects:
they do not contain by themselves the entire result of the query, but allow
the user to read it using several methods. We will use
[reflink2 resultset.read_all tcp_ssl_resultset::read_all], which just
reads all the rows in the resultset and places them in a `std::vector`
of [reflink row] objects:

[tutorial_read]

Rows are essentially arrays of [reflink value]s . A [reflink value]
is a union-like class of all types allowed in MySQL. You can access the row's
contents using [refmem row values].

[tutorial_values]

Let's break this down: from our vector of rows, we're selecting the first one
using `std::vector::at`. That row contains a single value, which we retrieve
using [refmem row values] and `std::vector::at`. We finally stream the value
to `std::cout`, which prints the expected phrase to the console.

To learn more about how to use the [reflink value] class, read [link mysql.values this section].

[heading Closing the connection]

Once we are done with the connection, we close it by calling
[reflink2 connection.close tcp_ssl_connection::close]. Note that
this will send a final quit packet to the MySQL server to notify
we are closing the connection, and thus may fail.

[tutorial_close]

[heading Final notes]

This concludes our __Self__ tutorial! You can now read more
about [link mysql.values MySQL values], 
[link mysql.queries text queries], [link mysql.prepared_statements
prepared statements] and [link mysql.resultsets resultsets]. You can also
look at more complex [link mysql.examples examples].
