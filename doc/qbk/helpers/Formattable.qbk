[section:boost__mysql__Formattable Formattable concept]

A type `T` is `Formattable` if it can be passed as a format argument to SQL formatting
functions, like [reflink format_sql] or [refmem format_context_base append_value].

Formally, a type `T` satisfies `Formattable` if any of the following are true:

* It satisfies [reflink2 WritableFieldTuple WritableField]. This includes scalar types and optionals.
* The class [reflink formatter] has been specialized for `T`.

For a reference table on built-in formattable types, see [link mysql.sql_formatting.reference this section].
