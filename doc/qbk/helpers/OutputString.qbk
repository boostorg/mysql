[section:boost__mysql__OutputString OutputString concept]

An `OutputString` is a narrow character string type that can be used as output for
operations that generate a string. Types like `std::string`, `std::basic_string<char, Traits, Allocator>`
or `boost::static_string<N>` satisfy this concept.

Formally, a type `T` satisfies `OutputString` if all of the following are true:

* It satisfies the `std::movable` concept.
* Has an `append(const char* data, std::size_t size)` member function that can
  be used to add a character range to the string.
* Has a `clear()` function that can be used to remove all characters from the string.
