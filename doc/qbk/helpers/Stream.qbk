[section:boost__mysql__Stream Stream concept]

`Stream` should meet both the `AsyncStream` and `SyncStream` requirements,
[@boost:/libs/beast/doc/html/beast/concepts/streams.html as defined by Boost.Beast here].
Additionally, the type `boost::asio::ssl::stream<Stream>` should be valid and usable
to both read and write data over SSL.
