[section:boost__mysql__ExecutionRequest ExecutionRequest concept]

An execution request represents a SQL statement to be executed by the
server, plus any required parameters. It may model
a plain text query, a client-side formatted query with parameters,
or a prepared statement handle with parameters.

Formally, a type `T` is a `ExecutionRequest` if it fulfills any of the following:

* It is convertible to [reflink string_view]. In this case, the execution request
  contains a text query to be run by the server.
* An instantiation of the [reflink bound_statement_tuple] class, or a (possibly cv-qualified)
  reference to it.
* An instantiation of the [reflink bound_statement_iterator_range] class, or a (possibly cv-qualified)
  reference to it.
* An instantiation of the [reflink with_params_t] class, or a (possibly cv-qualified)
  reference to it.

This definition may be extended in future versions, but the above types will still satisfy `ExecutionRequest`.
