[section:boost__mysql__WritableFieldTuple WritableFieldTuple concept]

A type `T` is a `WritableFieldTuple` if it's a `std::tuple` specialization,
or a reference to one, and all element types fulfill the exposition-only
concept `FieldLike`. Empty tuples satisfy `WritableFieldTuple`.

Currently, a type `T2` satisfies `FieldLike` if a [reflink field_view]
can be constructed from `T2`. The exact definition may change in future releases.

However, the types listed in [link mysql.fields.cpp_to_mysql this table] are guaranteed to satisfy `FieldLike`.
