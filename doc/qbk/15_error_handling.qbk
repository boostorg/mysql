[section:error_handling Error handling and available overloads]

This section describes the different error handling strategies
you may use with this library, as well as the different overloads
available for each function involving network transfers.

This library uses Boost.System error codes and exceptions,
like Asio and Beast. Some server-reported errors may include additional
diagnostics information. For example, if you issue a query 
and one of the referenced fields does not exist, the server will return
an error message indicating which was the offending field. This library
makes these diagnostics available through the following classes and
functions:

[variablelist
    [
        [[reflink diagnostics]]
        [
            An object containing this extra diagnostic information
            about an error. [refmem diagnostics server_message] contains the server-generated error
            string, if any.
        ]
    ]
    [
        [[reflink error_with_diagnostics]]
        [
            An exception that inherits from `boost::system::system_error`
            that contains a `diagnostics` object.
        ]
    ]
    [
        [[reflink throw_on_error]]
        [A utility function to check an `error_code` and throw an `error_with_diagnostics` if the operation failed.]
    ]
    [
        [[reflink is_fatal_error]]
        [Checks whether an `error_code` is [link mysql.error_handling.fatal fatal] and thus requires re-establishing the connection.]
    ]
]

Every piece of functionality involving network transfers is offered in four versions:

* [*Synchronous with exceptions]. When they fail, they throw an [reflink error_with_diagnostics] exception.
* [*Synchronous with [reflink error_code] and [reflink diagnostics]]. These functions output an `error_code` and a `diagnostics`
  object by lvalue reference to report failures.
* [*Asynchronous, without `diagnostics`]. When they fail, they call the completion handler with a non-empty `error_code`.
* [*Asynchronous, with `diagnostics`]. They have a `diagnostics&` parameter before the `CompletionToken`.
  When they fail, they set the `diagnostics` parameter to any server-provided
  diagnostic information, if available, and then call the completion handler with a non-empty `error_code`.

[heading Types of errors]

This library defines the following types of errors:

[table
    [
        [Type of error]
        [Values contained in...]
        [Error category]
        [Description]
    ]
    [
        [Client errors]
        [[reflink client_errc] enum]
        [[reflink get_client_category]]
        [Failures detected by Boost.MySQL, like corrupt messages.]
    ]
    [
        [Common server errors]
        [[reflink common_server_errc] enum]
        [[reflink get_common_server_category]]
        [
            Errors reported by the server, common to both MySQL and MariaDB.
            No new codes will be added here, since the two DBs are currently developed independently.
        ]
    ]
    [
        [MySQL-specific server errors]
        [Integer codes in [br][include_file boost/mysql/mysql_server_errc.hpp]]
        [[reflink get_mysql_server_category]]
        [
            Errors reported by the server, specific to MySQL. New codes will be added in the future.
        ]
    ]
    [
        [MariaDB-specific server errors]
        [Integer codes in [br][include_file boost/mysql/mariadb_server_errc.hpp]]
        [[reflink get_mariadb_server_category]]
        [
            Errors reported by the server, specific to MariaDB. New codes will be added in the future.
        ]
    ]
]

Note that new codes are added frequently, so server-specific codes
are represented as integers, instead of enums.

[heading:fatal Fatal vs. non-fatal errors]

When an operation on a established connection (like a query execution)
results in an error, two situations may happen:

* The connection object is left in a well-known state. You can safely use the object
  to run further operations without problems. For instance, if a query fails with
  `common_server_errc::er_no_such_table` because you misspelled a table name,
  it is safe to run other queries after the failed one. Such errors are called [*non-fatal].
* The connection object is left un an unknown state. Further operations will fail with
  unpredictable results. You should close and re-establish the connection.
  These are [*fatal] errors, and include protocol and network errors.

You can use [reflink is_fatal_error] to distinguish between fatal and non-fatal error codes.

[heading Security notes on diagnostics]

The error message given by [refmem diagnostics server_message] [*may contain user-provided input,
and should be treated as untrusted]. For certain errors, the MySQL server will include the offending
field names and values, which may contain arbitrary input. Please use with caution.

This message may contain non-ASCII characters. It's encoded using the connection's character set.

[heading:system_result Using boost::system::result]

Some functions, like [refmem basic_format_context get], use
[@boost:/libs/system/doc/html/system.html#ref_boostsystemresult_hpp `boost::system::result<T>`]
to communicate errors. `result<T>` contains either a value (an instance of `T`), or an [reflink error_code],
if the operation failed. `result<T>` is similar to `std::expected`, but only requires C++11.

Given a `result<T>` object `r`, you can get its contained value calling `r.value()`.
If `r` contained an error, a `boost::system::result` exception with the contained
error code is thrown. `r.has_value()`, `r.has_error()` and `r.error()` can be
used to inspect the object.
