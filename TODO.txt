sha256_password auth plugin
	Implement algorithm
	Integ tests to use it
	Skip integ tests in mariadb
	Verify that with no SSL, sha256 fails (preferably without sending the password in plaintext)
	Check the two (caching and no-caching)
	absence may cause BadUser tests to fail in 8.0: remove corrective measures here
	Test for an unknown auth plugin
	Update readme
	Unit test for auth_more_data
Multiresultset
	Text protocol
	Binary protocol (stored procedures)
Handshake
	compression
	SSL certificate & common name validation
Usability
	Should make_error_code be public?
	Connection quit
	Incomplete query reads: how does this affect further queries?
	Metadata in rows: being able to index by name
	Iterators for sync resultset iteration
	Consideration of timezones
	Types
		Decimal
		Bit
		Geometry
	UNIX socket connection
	connection::connect that handles TCP/Unix and MySQL connect
	connection::run_sql that hides the resultset concept
Consider if header-only is a good idea
Technical debt
	Integ tests for not enough capabilities
	Integ tests for ssl_mode::enable and SSL not available
	Review convention in test names
	Review named_param
	Copy operations for handshake
	Review handshake auth_plugin_data - seems like buffer overrun is possible (auth data string_lenenc?)
	Take fetch_many() algorithm out into network_algorithms (e.g. read_many_rows)
	clear_errors() function to clear error_info and error_code at once
	Concept checking for StreamType
	Review async initiations
		See if async_initiate is applicable
		See if we can drop the dependence on beast
	Review close() of the stream on error
	Review valid() for moved-from resultsets (should it return always true?)
	Force the same number of values in each row as in fields()
	CMake exporting?
	Integration test for network errors (e.g. host unreachable)
	Test zero dates
	Rework deserialize_row_fn to allow cursors
	Test prepared statement binding to procedure out params
	More thorough testing for several NULLs in integration testing
	Query and statement tests for DELETEs
	prepared_statement::execute(): static_assert(), handle value&, const value&, anything convertible
	Test for too many connections: do we have a buffer overrun there? (error msg shows incomplete)
