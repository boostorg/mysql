/**
 * \brief A connection to a MySQL server.
 * \details
 * Represents a connection to a MySQL server.
 * This is the main I/O object that this library implements. It's logically comprised
 * of session state and an internal stream (usually a socket). The stream is not directly
 * accessible. It's constructed using the executor passed to the constructor.
 *
 * This class supports establishing connections
 * with servers using TCP, TCP over TLS and UNIX sockets.
 *
 * The class is named `any_connection` because it's not templated on a `Stream`
 * type, as opposed to \ref connection. New code should prefer using `any_connection`
 * whenever possible.
 *
 * Compared to \ref connection, this class:
 *
 * - Is type-erased. The type of the connection doesn't depend on the transport being used.
 * - Is easier to connect, as \ref connect and \ref async_connect handle hostname resolution.
 * - Can always be re-connected after being used or encountering an error.
 * - Always uses `asio::any_io_executor`.
 * - Has the same level of performance.
 *
 * This is a move-only type.
 *
 * \par Default completion tokens
 * The default completion token for all async operations in this class is
 * `with_diagnostics(asio::deferred)`, which allows you to use `co_await`
 * and have the expected exceptions thrown on error.
 *
 * \par Thread safety
 * Distinct objects: safe. \n
 * Shared objects: unsafe. \n
 * This class is <b>not thread-safe</b>: for a single object, if you
 * call its member functions concurrently from separate threads, you will get a race condition.

     *     only if the server supports it.
